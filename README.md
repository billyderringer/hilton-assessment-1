### Hilton Assessment 1
##### My Process
* Created a mockup using CorelDRAW for accurate specs
* Built basic file structure
* Each content section is placed in a template container
* SCSS is used for styling
* The page looked a little empty at the bottom so I added a simple Google map
* Finally, index.php is necessary to allow for Heroku deploy (I just use the hobby dynos)
